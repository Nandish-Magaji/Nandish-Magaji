# About
A dedicated .NET And Angular FullStack Developer with a passion for solving complex problems and continuously expanding my technical expertise.

Hello There!üëãüèª 
**Nandish** here!

I have pursued my **Bachelor of Computer Applications** degree from **Bengaluru City University!**
My belief is to _adapt_ and _excel_ in every domain, embracing _multitasking_ to streamline operations and reduce staffing costs. I envision myself as a valuable asset to any organization.
I am deeply committed to the attainment of my goals and objectives.

I'm on the way to attaining advanced concepts! And Soon will get into it..

My current focus is on **.Net Angular Full-Stack**. I also want to learn **AI & ML** by integrating them into my _Full-Stack Journey_, **Cloud Computing**, And one **Automation Testing Tool** for Efficiency-Check!

You may notice that this guy has addressed almost **Every Top Domain's** for running Applications, But I deeply believe that one should have enough _knowledge_ for maintaining in hard times like emergencies to deal with each domain _flexibly!_ Which _may not_ be useful for _Top Companies_, but small firms get an **All-rounder Valuable Asset** to accomplish any _urgent Deadlines_, etc.

**My approach to learning** is to practice consistently, stay motivated, seek inspiration, revise what I learn, and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies for effective problem-solving!

**Congratulations on making it this far!** Thank you for taking the time to read up to this point! :) ‚ù§Ô∏è
